**Stage 1/4: Welcome to Simple Currency Converter**

**Description**

To start things off, you need to print a message to greet your users: Welcome to Currency Converter!

The next thing you need to do is print the list of currencies that the program can convert. For now, show the currencies and their equivalents in USD:

Exchange rates

| COUNTRY | RATES |
|---------|-------|
| USD     | 1.0   |
| JPY     | 113.5 |
| EUR     | 0.89  |
| RUB     | 74.36 |
| GBP     | 0.75  |

The rates can fluctuate over time; for this project, use the list above throughout all stages.

**Objectives**

In this stage, your program should output:

* A welcome message;
* A list of currencies and their rates.

**Example**

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

`Welcome to Currency Converter!
1 USD equals  1 USD
1 USD equals  113.5 JPY
1 USD equals  0.89 EUR
1 USD equals  74.36 RUB
1 USD equals  0.75 GBP`
